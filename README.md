# Yet Another Diablo 2 (Resurrected) Grail Tracker


## Running and building from source

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

Then in root directory:

`poetry install`

`poetry run python main.py`

`poetry run pyinstaller main.spec`

## Downloading

Look in a [releases](https://github.com/mfrlin/yad2gt/releases) on GitHub. v0.1.0 only built and tested on Windows 10, x64 processor.

#### Why is program so large?

Unfortunately that's just the way it is with programs written in Python. There are plans to improve this in the future.

## Features

- see through and click through overlay
- you can "unlock" the overlay which makes it not click through (will add features like expanding item lists that require clicking)

- item search from where you can mark item as found (and missing)
- overlay displays statistics

## Help

If you want to contribute I would appreciate images for:
- checkboxes
- button for opening and closing item search window
- system tray icon
- button for unlocking and locking of overlay*
- hand cursor replacement*

\* Those are actually fine I think but I don't know if I can use assets ripped from game.
